Once installed in Zotero, activate it: Tools > Night Preferences, and select "Enable Dark Theme".

## 😢 Limitations

- Popup menus do not have proper styling on some platforms.
- currently using CSS filter functions in order to make the pdfs dark, however this is rather slow. 


## ✅ To-do
- [ ] Make prettier, more curves. Basically redesign zotero a bit
- [ ] Add more themes
- [x] Add user preferences
- [ ] Write contributing guide

## 💪 Contributing

However, getting setup for Zotero plugin development is a bit of a pain in the ass.

What you need to do

- [ ] Download Zotero 60 ESR
- [ ] Git clone
- [ ] yarn
- [ ] do the zotero plugin stuff (expound on this)
- [ ] Launch zotero with --debugger and -somethingcaches
- [ ] Launch Firefox 60
- [ ] In Firefox, go to devtools, go to settings, click "enable remote debugging" and the one next to it that's also about debugging.
- [ ] In Zotero, go to setting, advanced, config editor, look up "debugging" and click on "allow remote debugging"
- [ ] In Firefox, click the hamburger menu in the top right -> web developer -> Connect...
- [ ] Enter localhost:6100

Wow now you can finally do things.
